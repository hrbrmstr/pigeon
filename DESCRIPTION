Description: 'Portable Game Notation' ('PGN') is a plain text computer-processible format 
    for recording chess games (both the moves and related data), supported by many chess 
    programs. It was was devised around 1993, by Steven J. Edwards, and was first 
    popularized via the 'Usenet' newsgroup 'rec.games.chess'. 'PGN' is structured 
    "for easy reading and writing by human users and for easy parsing and generation by 
    computer programs." The chess moves themselves are given in algebraic chess notation.
    Tools are provided to parse 'PGN' files into a data frame.
